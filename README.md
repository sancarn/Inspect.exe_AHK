# Inspect.exe_AHK
An attempted reimplementation of Inspect.exe in plain AHK.

This project and the UIA Library was originally created by neptercn [here](https://github.com/neptercn/UIAutomation). However, the project hasn't been developed for 4 years. Thus I decided to take his code, figure out how it worked, refactor it to make it commonly understandable and finally extend it's functionality.

The Inspect.exe_AHK project should also be a good start for anyone who wishes to use the UIA.ahk library and the power it holds for their own automation projects. You can often extract a lot more information using UIA than with standard Win32 APIs.
